      <p class="tagline">Hey… if starting feels harder than it “should,” 
        that doesn’t mean you’re lazy.
         ADHD brains don’t run on pressure — they run on interest and meaning. 
         When something clicks, you’re capable of incredible focus and creativity. 
         You don’t need more shame. You need tools that meet you where you are. 
         Let’s just take this one small step together. 💜</p>

      <h3>About ADHD 💜</h3>
      <p>
        ADHD is not a lack of intelligence or effort.
        It is a difference in executive functioning.
        Many people with ADHD are highly creative,
        intuitive, empathetic, and capable of deep focus
        when genuinely interested.
      </p>

      <p>
        Struggling to start tasks is not laziness.
        It is often difficulty with task initiation —
        a neurological barrier, not a character flaw.
      </p>

      <p>
        Systems designed with compassion make a difference.
        This tool is one small example of that.
