### Project Description
Blame it on fate! was built to address one specific struggle: starting. Many individuals with ADHD experience decision paralysis and executive dysfunction, making task initiation feel disproportionately difficult.

Instead of forcing choice, this tool removes it. Users enter a few tasks and spin to randomly select one turning avoidance into a game. The randomness reduces mental friction, lowers pressure, and encourages immediate action.

The app also integrates affirming messaging to promote self-understanding rather than shame. It’s not about fixing ADHD , it’s about designing systems that work with it.
### The Problem statement
Many people with ADHD struggle with starting tasks. When there are multiple things to do, choosing one can feel overwhelming. This often leads to decision paralysis and procrastination .

### The Solution
Blame it On Fate! solves this by removing the need to choose. Users enter a few tasks and spin to randomly select one. This reduces mental pressure and makes starting feel easier and more playful.

The app also includes supportive messages to encourage self-compassion and motivation, helping users feel understood rather than judged.

#### Diagrams

**System Architecture:**

![Architecture Diagram]![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a008d84d-08bc-4f4b-ad17-483364158825)
Blame it On Fate! is a simple front-end web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML handles the structure (task inputs, spin button, result display).

CSS handles the styling and animations (spin effect, layout, design).

JavaScript handles the logic (random task selection, timer, motivational quotes).

All processing happens on the client side in the browser. There is no backend or database. User input is temporarily stored in memory while the app is running.

**Application Workflow:**

![Workflow]![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a008d84d-08bc-4f4b-ad17-483364158825)
The user enters 3–4 tasks into the input fields.

The user clicks the Spin button.

JavaScript randomly selects one task.

The selected task is displayed with a dramatic animation.

A 5-minute focus timer starts automatically.

A motivational quote is displayed to encourage action.

This workflow reduces decision fatigue and encourages immediate task initiation through gamification.
